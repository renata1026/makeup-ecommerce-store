Welcome to Makeup 4 Life, a React application designed to assist users in selecting their ideal makeup products. With Makeup 4 Life, users have the ability to filter products by type and price.

To get started, simply choose the desired makeup products and set the preferred price range. Based on your selections, the app will generate a list of makeup products tailored to your preferences. You can then add the products to your shopping cart and proceed to the cart page to review your order. If you change your mind, you can easily remove any unwanted products.
